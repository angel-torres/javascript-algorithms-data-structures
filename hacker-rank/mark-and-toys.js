 *  -----------------
 *
 *
 * Mark and Jane are very happy after having their first child. 
 * Their son loves toys, so Mark wants to buy some. 
 * There are a number of different toys lying in front of him, 
 * tagged with their prices. Mark has only a certain amount 
 * to spend, and he wants to maximize the number of toys 
 * he buys with this money.
 *
 * Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, 
 * what is the maximum number of toys Mark can buy?
 *
 *
 *
 * e.g.
 *
 * prices = [1, 2, 3, 4] // prices of toys
 * k = 7 // amount of dollars he can spend
 *
 * maximumToys(prices, k) // he can buy [1,2,3] for 6
 *
 * 
 * Complete the function maximumToys in the editor below. 
 * It should return an integer representing the maximum 
 * number of toys Mark can purchase.
 *
 * MAXIMUMTOYS HAS THE FOLLOWING PARAMETER(S):
 *
 * prices: an array of integers representing toy prices
 * k: an integer, Mark's budget
 *
 *
